# Coursera-Getting_and_Cleaning_Data-Course_Project

This repository contains the files for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project.
The content are to include:
1. README.md - (this file) that explains the files.
2. CodeBook.md - that that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.
3. run_analysis.R - The R code file.
4. TidyDataSet.txt - The tidy data output of the script.

The objectives of the R Script is to do the following:
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
